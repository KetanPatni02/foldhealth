# Project Instructions for Claude

This file is auto-loaded by Claude Code on every session in this repo. Add any
rules, preferences, or context you want Claude to follow. Bullets work fine —
keep entries short and specific. Newest at the top.

## Working agreements

- **Building any new UI? Invoke the `fold-feature-builder` skill FIRST.**
  For every request that generates, builds, creates, scaffolds, or adds new
  front-end code (a component, page, screen, view, table, drawer, modal, form,
  dashboard, or feature), run the `fold-feature-builder` skill before writing
  code. It enforces the design system (reusable `src/components` primitives,
  Inter typography, tokens, Solar `*-linear` icons, the shared `FilterChip`)
  and requires that any data shown in the UI is persisted to Supabase — with a
  parallel migration + seed, and a note telling the user to ask **Alok Kumar**
  to run the migration and seed the database.
- **Drawer headers: NEVER let the close button draw its own border.**
  When `headerRight` has action buttons, pass `noCloseDivider` to `<Drawer>`
  AND insert your own `<span className={styles.headerDivider} />` (1px × 16px,
  `var(--neutral-150)`) between the last action button and the close button.
  This rule is the single most-repeated mistake — if you're putting anything
  in `headerRight`, you almost certainly need both pieces. See
  `EmailPreviewDrawer.jsx` / `ClinicalNotePanel.jsx` for the canonical
  pattern. Same divider class goes between distinct action groups.
- **Use Bun, never npm or pnpm.** Bun is the package manager + script
  runner for this repo. Always use `bun install` (not `npm install` /
  `pnpm install`) and `bun run <script>` (not `npm run` / `pnpm run`).
  The `bun.lockb` lockfile is the source of truth; introducing
  `package-lock.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml` will desync deps. If you see
  Vite errors like `Failed to resolve import "@sentry/react"`, the fix
  is `bun install` from the worktree root, not switching managers.
- **Don't push to GitHub on your own.** I'll explicitly say "push" or
  "commit and push" when I want changes shipped. Default behavior is: edit
  files, verify locally, and stop. Committing locally is fine when I ask for
  a commit, but `git push` always requires an explicit ask.
- **No Co-Authored-By trailer in commits.** Do not add
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` or any similar attribution line to commit
  messages.
- **Always use reusable components from `src/components/`.** Drawer,
  Button, Toggle, Badge, Select, Slider, Switch, ConfirmDialog, etc.
  Search the components folder before writing a new one. New components
  should themselves be reusable primitives, not one-offs.
- **Filter badges: always use `src/components/FilterChip`.** Every filter
  across the app must use this one component so filter badges look and
  behave identically (`Label ⌄` inactive → `Label : Value ✕` active, with a
  popover of options, optional `searchable`/`iconKind`). Never re-implement a
  `*FilterChip` or use a plain `Select`/`<select>` as a filter — the
  guardrails flag re-implementations. Migrate legacy filter UI to
  `FilterChip` when you touch it.
- **Follow the Fold Health typography system.** Inter is the only font.
  Use size/weight/color tokens from `src/tokens/tokens.css` — don't
  hand-pick `font-size`, `font-weight`, or hex colors.
- **Use Solar (Iconify) icons.** `solar:*-linear` variants first; custom
  SVGs only as a last resort, kept in shared icon modules. **All icons
  must render at 1px stroke** — never use `-outline` variants (they use
  heavier fill-based outlines). Custom SVGs must set `strokeWidth="1"`.
  A global CSS rule in `src/index.css` already forces Iconify linear
  icons from 1.5px down to 1px.

## Project overview

- React 19 + Vite 8 SPA, hash-based routing, Zustand state, Tailwind 4 + CSS
  Modules, Supabase backend, Bun as the package manager.
- Run with `bun install && bun run dev`. App listens on port 5173.
- Main feature areas live under `src/features/` — `tasks`, `agent-builder`,
  `home`, `calls`, `messages`, `analytics`, `settings`.

## Conventions

- Add new node types for the agent builder via
  `src/features/agent-builder/nodes/nodeConfig.js` (single source of truth —
  both NodePanel and ConversationNode read from it).
- Drawers across the app use the shared `Drawer` component (700px, 8px
  inset, 16px radius). Action buttons go in `headerRight`, never in `footer`.
- **Always place a divider between distinct groups of action buttons** in a
  drawer header. Use `<span className={styles.headerDivider} />` (1px ×
  16px, `var(--neutral-150)`) and pass `noCloseDivider` to `<Drawer>` so
  the close button doesn't add a second automatic border.
- Solar (Iconify) icon set is the default. Reach for `solar:*-linear`
  variants first; only build a custom SVG when no good Solar match exists.

## When making changes

- Verify in the browser preview before claiming "done."
- Don't add comments that just restate what the code does — only keep the
  ones that explain *why*.
- Update `README.md`'s "Recent Changes" section when shipping a notable
  feature.

## General behavior

These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use
judgment.

### Think before coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### Simplicity first

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If
yes, simplify.

### Surgical changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### Goal-driven execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make
it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs,
fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come
before implementation rather than after mistakes.
