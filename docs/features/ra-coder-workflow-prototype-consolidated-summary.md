# RA Coder Workflow Prototype, Consolidated Summary 


<span style="color: rgb(15, 71, 97);">1. Changes Required on Prototype</span>

<span>**Worklist**, mostly resolved, with new structural items </span>

- <span>Resolved: DOS Source filter added, with source indicator now visible directly on each row </span>


- <span>Resolved: Demo data cleaned up, varied visit types, varied Open ICD counts, correct POS labels, all dates in 2026 </span>


- <span>Resolved: Assignee/Status consolidated into dedicated Support Team and Coder columns with status shown inline </span>


- <span>Needs resolution: worklist header still shows "Due Date" as the active sort, but the talk track explicitly calls for **Created Date sort**, direct conflict between what's built and what's scripted for the demo. </span>


- <span>**New:** Either remove the current Status column from the worklist and replace it with a visual status-progress indicator (e.g., a stepper showing where the record sits in CODER→QA→COMPLIANCE), or remove the column entirely, needs a design decision, not both. </span>


- <span>**New:** Grouping logic on the worklist and Single View should be consistent, grouped by document, assignment, and status the same way in both places, rather than each screen having its own grouping logic. This extends the earlier "verify patient/document-level grouping isn't blending Fold/Cozeva logic" item, now explicitly requiring worklist/Single View parity. </span>


- <span>**New, terminology:** Rename the status value "Returned" to **"Rebuttal"** throughout the worklist and Single View. </span>

<span>**Document intake / extraction / Add Record flow** </span>

- <span>Remove the separate "start extraction" button, OCR triggers automatically on upload </span>


- <span>Support multiple file upload (not just single file) </span>


- <span>Nightly job reads each uploaded document and auto-adds records directly if all 5 required fields are correctly extracted, manual Pass/Fail review may only be needed for documents the job can't auto-validate. Needs confirmation with Ketan/Alok, then with Astrana. </span>


- <span>Failed-extraction handling: a document can fail specifically because of an incorrect file extension. Prototype should demonstrate this failure state and surface it immediately, not silently drop the record. </span>


- <span>**New:** The global-level "Add Record" flow (as opposed to adding a document at the row level) currently shows two separate document-upload panels side by side (left and right). This should be simplified to the standard/default single upload screen, remove the duplicate side-by-side panels. </span>

<span>**Single View / Sweep Mode** </span>

- <span>Complete the Single View change from single-level to document-level </span>


- <span>Full/Mini Sweep distinction removed; a single unified Sweep Mode is retained and is part of the intended talk track </span>


- <span>Fix the underlying issue this doesn't solve on its own: accepting one ICD applies across all DOS's sharing that code, with no easy way to navigate to each affected DOS </span>


- <span>Regression: "DOS: Set 1" labeling is still showing in the Single View panel header, despite the agreed switch to Created Date labeling, flag to Ketan/Alok. </span>


- <span>**New:** Comments, Activity Log, History, and Claims should each be placed at the **DOS level** within Single View, not at the record/patient level. This also resolves how Claim access should work, it should live directly on the DOS itself rather than requiring a separate jump/navigation mechanism. </span>

<span>**Suspects & Recaptures** </span>

- <span>Partially addressed: section header still reads "ICDs Not Associated with DOS," not "Suspects and Recaptures", the individual entry does carry a "Suspect" tag, but the header rename hasn't shipped </span>


- <span>Resolved: Accept/Decline actions now present as clickable checkmark/X actions for standard ICD rows </span>


- <span>Fold already pulls actual ICD codes (not just HCC codes) directly from Astrana's API for suspects/recaptures, no need to build HCC-to-ICD mapping logic for coders; confirms reduced scope on the "HCC-scoped ICD dropdown" item to override/correction cases only </span>


- <span>**Missed Opportunity, full requirement set:**  </span>


- <span>Default action for suspect/recapture rows should be **Missed Opportunity**, not the Accept tick mark used on regular ICD rows </span>


- <span>Must be moved out of the "three dots" overflow menu and shown as the primary, visible button/icon by default </span>


- <span>For suspect/recapture rows specifically, the two default actions should be labeled **"Missed Opportunity"** (accept-equivalent) and **"Dismiss"** (decline-equivalent), distinct from "Accept/Decline" on standard ICD rows </span>


- <span>Clicking Missed Opportunity should do two things: (a) send the entry to the ASM file as an "Added" record, and (b) annotate/flag the physician that they missed this code, needs confirmation this dual behavior is wired up on the backend </span>


- <span>Fix the underlying icon bug, the "three dots" / Missed Opportunity icon wasn't rendering or functioning correctly during the internal walkthrough </span>


- <span>None of the above is confirmed as built in either screenshot reviewed so far </span>


- <span>Default ICD selection should show the clinically correct code </span>


- <span>DOS selection should be restricted to single-select tied to the existing document, no custom date </span>


- <span>Auto-populate Rendering Provider and Place of Service on DOS selection </span>

<span>**Other UX reductions** </span>

- <span>Auto-set status to Complete when "Add to Work List" is clicked, where applicable </span>

<span>**Process/copy fixes** </span>

- <span>"Send to Billing" language updated to **"Ready for ASM generation"** </span>


- <span>Confirm lab/imaging documents don't create new worklist rows or count toward a coder's review denominator </span>


- <span>Activity Log: should also live at the DOS level (see Single View above), but exact content/scope still needs confirmation. </span>

<span style="color: rgb(15, 71, 97);">2. Expectation from the Prototype </span>

<span>**2.1 Role-specific prototype / Vercel link** </span>

<span>Build around four confirmed roles, Support Team, Coder, QA, Compliance. Talk track confirms the demo should be enacted persona by persona, starting with Support Team. </span>

<span>**2.2 Reflect assignment logic and status changes** </span>

<span>Prototype should behave per the documented CODER→QA→COMPLIANCE flow, QA sampling percentages, Returned/Rebuttal logic, and overdue/SLA transitions, including showing resulting state changes. </span>

<span>**2.3 Explorable like a real product** </span>

<span>Astrana's team should be able to click through themselves, search a patient, open a record, take an action, see the status update. </span>

<span>**2.4 Advantages of the Review Screen that need to be highlighted** </span>

1. <span>Transparency into errored records that Cozeva doesn't surface at all today. </span>


2) <span>Instead of an errored document being shared externally with the physician as-is, Fold surfaces the error upfront, internally, before it goes anywhere. </span>


3. <span>Demonstrate a document that fails specifically because of an incorrect file extension, a concrete, visible failure case. </span>


4) <span>In Cozeva, a failed document waits until the next day to be corrected and picked up for review; in Fold, the error is shown immediately. </span>

<span>**2.5 Demo patient use cases needed** </span>

<span>The demo data should include, at minimum: </span>

- <span>A row that is ready for Support Team review, document already uploaded, but sitting in a pending status </span>


- <span>A Reject interaction, a document or record that gets actively rejected during the walkthrough, so the rejection path itself is visible (not just the happy path) </span>

<span>**2.3.1 Talk Track / Guided Exploration** </span>

<span>**Path A, Support Team** </span>

1. <span>Support Team member uploads the document. </span>


2) <span>A nightly job reads the document and auto-adds the record directly if all 5 required fields are correctly extracted, no manual action needed in this case. </span>


3. <span>The document remains attached to the resulting record for reference. </span>


4) <span>Confirm the worklist is sorted by Created Date (this is where the current "Due Date" build discrepancy will surface if not fixed beforehand). </span>


5. <span>Walk through what happens when a document fails (e.g., wrong file extension), show the error appears immediately, not next day. </span>


6) <span>Walk through the Reject interaction on a use-case record, show the resulting status and where it routes. </span>


7. <span>**Explicitly demonstrate: the Coder does not begin review until the Support Team has reviewed the document.** This should be shown as a hard sequencing step in the walkthrough, the record should visibly sit unavailable/blocked for the Coder until Support Team action is taken. </span>

<span>**Path B, Coder** </span>

1. <span>Filter worklist to your name; note the combined AWV + HCC list with the AWV filter on Visit Type. </span>


2) <span>Confirm you cannot begin a record whose document hasn't cleared Support Team review yet (continuation of Path A step 7). </span>


3. <span>Open a record with multiple DOS from one uploaded document, confirm each is labeled by Created Date. </span>


4) <span>Once the Primary row is complete, move to Sweep Mode to address all other records assigned to you at once. </span>


5. <span>Within Sweep Mode: accept an ICD with highlighted evidence; decline another with a reason. </span>


6) <span>Open a record with a Suspect/Recapture, note the ICD is already provided directly from Astrana's API; check the section labeling and confirm whether "Missed Opportunity" and "Dismiss" appear as the default actions. </span>


7. <span>Select a DOS for the suspect from the dropdown; confirm Rendering Provider/POS auto-populate. </span>


8) <span>Mark the record "Complete" with one row still unactioned, confirm auto-accept/auto-delete behavior. </span>


9. <span>From within a DOS, confirm Comments, Activity Log, History, and Claims are all accessible directly at that DOS level. </span>

<span>**Path C, QA** </span>

1. <span>Filter to QA status, confirm only the sampled percentage appears. </span>


2) <span>Return a record with "Major issues", confirm it now shows as "Rebuttal" status and routes back to coder/CODER correctly. </span>


3. <span>Confirm a corrected record cycles back without losing prior work. </span>

<span>**Path D, Compliance** </span>

1. <span>Filter to Compliance status, confirm random-pull behavior, including records skipped by QA. </span>


2) <span>Confirm view-only restriction when a downstream stage is still in progress. </span>

<span style="color: rgb(15, 71, 97);">3. Summary of Plan for Next Steps </span>

1. <span>Pooja collates all points from both July 6 discussions (internal prep call + external Astrana review) plus this latest round of feedback. </span>


2) <span>Reconcile the Support-Team-gates-Coder rule with the previously confirmed SLA/overdue escalation logic, these need to work together, not contradict each other, before the walkthrough script is finalized. </span>


3. <span>Seed the two required demo use-cases (pending Support Team review; Reject interaction) into the patient data. </span>


4) <span>Get a screenshot or walkthrough of the expanded Suspect/Recapture row to close out the remaining items. </span>


5. <span>Share the Vercel link with Nallu and her team, using the role-specific talk track (Section 2.3.1) as the guided self-exploration script. </span>


6) <span>Collect their feedback and integrate it into the next iteration. </span>
