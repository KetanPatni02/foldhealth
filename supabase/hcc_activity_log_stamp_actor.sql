-- Make the HCC audit log say who actually wrote each row.
--
-- THE HOLE THIS CLOSES
-- `hcc_activity_log_insert` is WITH CHECK (true) for authenticated. Every
-- actor column — actor_id, actor_name, actor_role — arrives from the browser
-- and is written verbatim. Any signed-in user can POST a row attributed to
-- anybody, with any headline, at any timestamp. For a table whose entire job is
-- to be the compliance record of who touched which chart, that is the one
-- property it must have and does not.
--
-- drop_remaining_anon_policies.sql already called this policy out as the one
-- that "matters most" when it took `anon` off it. Taking anon off stopped
-- strangers forging entries; it did nothing about a logged-in user forging
-- entries as a colleague.
--
-- It is worse than it looks, because today the log cannot identify anyone at
-- all: makeActivityRow() sets `actor_id: payload.actorId || scope.actorId ||
-- null` (src/features/hcc/activityLog.js:141) and NOTHING in the codebase ever
-- passes actorId — `grep -rn actorId src` finds only that line and a UI key
-- filter. So actor_id is null on every one of the ~1,264 existing rows. The
-- audit trail has never had a real actor.
--
-- WHAT THIS DOES
--   1. A BEFORE INSERT trigger that overwrites actor_id with auth.uid() for any
--      caller holding a JWT. Client input for that column is discarded, not
--      validated — there is no version of "the browser knows best" here.
--   2. WITH CHECK (actor_id = auth.uid()::text) on the INSERT policy, so the
--      guarantee is enforced by RLS and not merely by the trigger. Belt and
--      braces: the trigger makes correct inserts succeed, the policy makes
--      incorrect ones impossible. Postgres evaluates WITH CHECK against the row
--      AFTER BEFORE-triggers have fired, so these compose rather than fight.
--
-- WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
-- actor_name and actor_role stay client-supplied, and that is intentional —
-- they are DISPLAY labels, not identity. The timeline legitimately writes
-- actor_name = 'System' for automated events (useAppStore.js:865) and 'SFTP'
-- for unattended ingest (HccHistoryDrawer.jsx:541), and HccHistoryDrawer
-- filters and groups on those exact strings (:135, :172, :208). Forcing them to
-- the signed-in user's name would relabel every machine-generated row as a
-- human and break the "Uploaded by" grouping.
--
-- The distinction to keep in your head: actor_name answers "what should this
-- row read as", actor_id now answers "who is accountable for it". Only the
-- second one is evidence. Reconcile against actor_id, never actor_name.
--
-- Append-only is already true and stays true: the table has exactly two
-- policies, SELECT and INSERT. With RLS on and no UPDATE or DELETE policy,
-- both are denied by default for authenticated. Nothing to add.
--
-- Existing rows keep actor_id = null. They are not retro-attributable — the
-- information was never captured — and inventing it would be the exact forgery
-- this migration exists to prevent. Null is the honest value.
--
-- NOT SECURITY DEFINER, on purpose. It needs no privilege it does not already
-- have, and a definer trigger here would re-open the lint finding that
-- lock_down_security_definer_functions.sql just closed.
