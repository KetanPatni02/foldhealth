-- Revoke accidental administrator grants on profiles.
--
-- Background: until profiles_signup_role_defaults.sql, handle_new_user() never
-- set admin_role, so every account inherited the column default
-- 'Business/Practice Owner'. That value is an admin marker — the
-- "Admins can update any profile" policy grants UPDATE on EVERY row to anyone
-- whose admin_role is 'Business/Practice Owner' or 'Admin/Practice Manager',
-- or whose clinical_roles contains 'Admin/Practice Manager'.
--
-- Audit of the 35 accounts holding it (2026-08-10) shows the grant was
-- indiscriminate, not deliberate:
--   • 21 @fold.health staff, mostly Viewer / Coder / Support / QA
--   •  7 @astranahealth.com — external customer accounts
--   •  7 personal addresses (gmail / yahoo / outlook / thelanby)
-- Only 4 of them carry an explicit admin marker.
--
-- This migration removes the accidental grants and keeps every deliberate one.
--
-- KEEP 'Business/Practice Owner' where the account is explicitly marked as an
-- administrator (role = 'Admin/Practice Manager' or that value present in
-- clinical_roles). Everyone else drops to 'Employer', the non-admin value
-- already used by 18 rows.
--
-- After this runs the administrator set is unchanged in intent: the same
-- people who were explicitly marked as admins keep access. Only the
-- accidental grants are removed. alokk@fold.health is in the keep set, so
-- there is no lock-out.

begin;

-- Snapshot for rollback. Downgraded rows become indistinguishable from
-- pre-existing 'Employer' rows, so the previous value has to be recorded.
