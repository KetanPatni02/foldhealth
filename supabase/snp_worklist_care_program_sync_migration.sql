-- SNP worklist ↔ SNP care program sync (backfill direction).
--
-- Forward direction lives in the app: addCareProgram('SNP') now calls
-- ensureSnpWorklistMembership, which inserts an snp_worklist_members row.
-- This migration handles the existing data:
--
--   1. Link snp_worklist_members.patient_id → patients.id by exact name
--      match (patient names are unique in the seed set). This is what makes
--      an SNP row click open the patient profile at all — the row handler
--      bails with a toast when patient_id is empty.
--   2. Unmatched members (no patients row of that name) self-link to their
--      own snp row id. PatientDetailView resolves ids across every worklist
--      slice, so a profile opened with the snpw-* id renders fine backed by
--      the SNP slice.
--   3. Every linked patient without an SNP care program gets one, so the
--      invariant holds: SNP worklist member ⇒ SNP care program enrolled.
--      start_date carries the member's trigger_date when present (that is
--      the closest thing to the real enrollment date), else today.
