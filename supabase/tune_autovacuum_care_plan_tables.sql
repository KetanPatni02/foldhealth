-- Free-tier Disk IO relief, round two: care-plan tables.
--
-- The Aug 21 tuning (supabase/tune_autovacuum_free_tier.sql) fixed 17 tiny
-- hot tables. That set is holding — every one of them still carries the
-- reloptions today and dead_pct is well under 30%.
--
-- What changed since then:
--   * The Sep 10 FK fix (fix_barrier_goals_fk_target.sql) made the barrier
--     join table start accepting writes for the first time. Combined with the
--     care-plan editor's delete-and-reinsert pattern (savePatientCarePlanBarrier)
--     it went from 0 writes to 11,599 in 24 days on 166 live rows.
--   * Several care-plan tables shipped or grew after Aug 21 and were never
--     tuned. They now show the same pattern the original 17 did: tiny table,
--     high churn, autovacuum thresholds tuned for a 1000-row table never fire.
--
-- Measured (2026-09-15, 176-day pg_stat_statements window):
--   Table                                 live  dead  dead_pct  last_av
--   patient_care_plan_versions               3    15   500.0%   never
--   care_plan_templates                     53    57   107.5%   never
--   population_groups                       30    28    93.3%   never
--   patient_care_plan_barriers             126    72    57.1%   Sep 14
--   patient_care_plan_barrier_goals        166    74    44.6%   Sep 14
--
-- The last two are already firing autovacuum, but only marginally — the
-- write rate outpaces the default threshold and dead_pct grows between
-- runs. Tightening the thresholds keeps them under 20%.
--
-- clinical_notes (13 live / 41 dead / 315%) is deliberately EXCLUDED. It is
-- an append-mostly table where dead tuples come from the versioning workflow
-- (write new version, mark old, retention), not from write amplification.
-- Autovacuum will catch up naturally on next churn cycle.
--
-- ── Also shipped this session, not in this file ────────────────────────────
-- savePatientCarePlanBarrier in useAppStore.js was rewritten to do diff-based
-- join sync instead of wipe-and-reinsert. Bulk status/priority changes now
-- issue zero writes to patient_care_plan_barrier_goals when goals are
-- unchanged, which is the common case. That is the primary IO relief; this
-- migration is the safety net so the tables that DO churn get compacted
-- promptly.
