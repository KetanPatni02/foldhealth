-- Lock down forms / form_responses — the last two tables where `anon`
-- could read AND write everything.
--
-- Why: RLS_POSTURE.md deliberately keeps these anon-READABLE so a patient
-- can open a shared #/f/{id} link without an account. But the original
-- policies were never scoped beyond "everything for everyone", which a live
-- probe confirmed:
--
--   GET    /rest/v1/form_responses  as anon → 200 with patient answers
--   PATCH  form_responses?id=eq.N   as anon → 204 (tamper with submissions)
--   DELETE forms?id=eq.N            as anon → 204 (delete any form)
--   POST   form_responses           as anon → passes RLS (spam vector)
--   GET    forms                    as anon → returns DRAFTS, not just shared
--
-- The anon key ships in the deployed JS bundle, so "knowing the key" is no
-- barrier. Every response row is one curl away from the public internet.
--
-- Design (keeps patient filling working end-to-end):
--
--   forms
--     anon    SELECT restricted to status='active' — share links serve
--             published forms only; drafts stop leaking.
--     anon    no writes. Builder CRUD is staff-only.
--   form_responses
--     anon    INSERT allowed — that IS the anonymous patient submission.
--     anon    UPDATE allowed ONLY while the row is still 'in_progress' and
--             stays 'in_progress' or flips to 'completed'. This preserves
--             savePartialResponse's upsert autosave and FormView's
--             submit-time flip of the same session row, while closing the
--             tamper path against completed submissions. Sequential bigint
--             ids make enumeration trivial, so this is a compromise, not a
--             guarantee — flagged in RLS_POSTURE.md follow-ups.
--     anon    no SELECT (a filler never reads back), no DELETE.
--   authenticated  full access to both, as today.
--
-- Existing policy names are unknown (forms_migration.sql predates the repo),
-- so every policy on these two tables is dropped first and rebuilt here.
