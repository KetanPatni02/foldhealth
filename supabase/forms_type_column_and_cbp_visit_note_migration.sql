-- Add a `form_type` classification to public.forms and seed the CBP Visit
-- Note template row.
--
-- WHY
-- The Settings > Content > Forms tab lists every form the org has authored,
-- but until now the only classification was the free-text `category` column
-- (values like "Program" / "Service" / "Others" carried over from an earlier
-- consent-component grouping). The care-gap Clinical Note workspace has to
-- pick a form template per gap by TYPE (Note vs Assessment vs Consent…),
-- and staff filtering by "show me all Notes" cannot rely on a freeform
-- string. This adds a discrete `form_type` enum that both the Settings
-- Forms table and the care-gap workspace can key off.
--
-- ENUM
--   'Note'        — clinical / visit notes (CBP Visit Note, DM Foot Exam…)
--   'Assessment'  — screenings and assessments (PHQ-9, ACEs…)
--   'Intake'      — new-patient / program intake
--   'Consent'     — attestations and consents
--   'Other'       — default; anything unclassified
--
-- Kept as a text column with a CHECK constraint (not a Postgres ENUM type)
-- so future values can be added by a plain ALTER TABLE without the type-
-- alter dance a Postgres ENUM requires.
--
-- SAFETY
--   • Column is added with DEFAULT 'Other' so existing rows backfill in the
--     same statement.
--   • Seed is guarded by WHERE NOT EXISTS on `name` so re-running the
--     migration is safe and won't overwrite hand-edits to the template. The
--     `id` is left to the bigint sequence — no code references a hardcoded
--     forms.id, only clinical_notes.form_type = 'cbp_visit_note' (a string
--     enum), so a stable id is not required.
