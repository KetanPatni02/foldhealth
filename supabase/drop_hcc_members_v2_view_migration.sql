-- Drop the hcc_members_v2 compatibility view.
--
-- History: when hcc_members was normalized (DOS list → hcc_member_visits,
-- doc status → hcc_member_documents), this view was added so the app could
-- keep reading the old fat-row shape. Because it looked like a table, write
-- paths started targeting it and failed on its derived columns
-- ("cannot insert into column dos_list of view"), which is how spawned
-- worklist rows silently vanished on reload.
--
-- The app no longer reads it: fetchHccMembers now reads hcc_members plus
-- the child tables directly and rebuilds the row shape in JS, and all
-- writes target base/child tables.
--
-- Safe to run any time after the store change ships. If any consumer were
-- missed, this fails loudly rather than leaving a second source of truth.

-- normalization — both exist on the base table — so repoint it there and
-- recreate. Same definition otherwise (security_invoker preserved so RLS
-- on underlying tables still applies).
