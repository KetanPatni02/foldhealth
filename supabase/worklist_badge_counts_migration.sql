-- One-row view of SubNav badge integers. Replaces six id-only REST queries
-- (hcc / awv / ccm / snp / jsa / patients) with a single select.
--
-- Two of those badges are not row counts: HCC is DISTINCT member_id (a
-- patient can have several coding records), and All Patients is the union
-- of normalized member ids across every slice. Both have to happen in SQL
-- or we would still be shipping the id columns to the client.
--
-- SECURITY INVOKER so RLS on the underlying tables still applies — a
-- security-definer view would leak every tenant's roster to any
-- authenticated session.
--
-- HEDIS is not in this view: the SubNav badge reads a local mock constant
-- (no network). The client adds HEDIS keys into all_patients after fetch.
