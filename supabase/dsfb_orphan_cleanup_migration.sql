-- Scrub orphaned Fold-native DSF-B gap rows.
--
-- A DSF-B gap should only be openable when the paired DSF-A note has
-- been saved with a Positive PHQ-2 (which flips DSF-A into Ready-for-
-- Review inside the note flow). Earlier test sessions produced a
-- state where a runtime-created DSF-B row was submitted on its own
-- while the paired DSF-A stayed `Open`, leaving inconsistent rows on
-- the worklist like `DSF-A: Open` + `DSF-B: Submitted`.
--
-- This migration removes every `source: fold-native` DSF-B gap on a
-- member whose paired DSF-A isn't `Completed`. Standalone DSF-B rows
-- from Astrana (`source: astrana`) are untouched — those are
-- ingestions the seed sets up on purpose.
--
-- Idempotent — a re-run finds no matching rows and is a no-op.
--
-- Ask Alok Kumar to run this migration on Supabase.
